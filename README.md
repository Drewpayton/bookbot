# Book Report Generator

This Python script generates a simple report for a given text file, specifically focusing on word count and letter frequency. The example used in this script is "Frankenstein" by Mary Shelley.

## Features
- **Word Count**: Counts the total number of words in the document.
- **Letter Frequency**: Counts the frequency of each letter (case-insensitive) and sorts the results in descending order of frequency.

## Usage

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. **File Path**: Update the `book_path` variable in the `main()` function with the path to your text file.
3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script using a Python interpreter.

```bash
python book_report.py
